# Img-Clssfn-resnet
This mini-project is to demonstrate Image classification using Convolution Neural Network with residual connections on a CIFAR dataset

Data is taken from the keras built in dataset: keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class.  There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The Labels are:
airplane : 0.
automobile : 1.
bird : 2.
cat : 3.
deer : 4.
dog : 5.
frog : 6.
horse : 7.
ship : 8
truck : 9
